# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. According to our result, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
2. According to our result, the overall p-value is significant smaller than 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero
3. The linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The lot 1 and lot 2 meet design specification as the variance doesn't exceed 100 pounds per square inch.
The lot 3 doesn't meet the design specifications. See below table.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
According to the t-test result, the overall PSI across all manufacturing lots has p-value equal to 0.06028 wichi is larger than the common 0.05 percent. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
P-value for Lot 1 is 1; P-value for lot 2 is 0.6072; P-value for lot 3 is 0.04168. The results indicate that for lot1 and lot 2, both p-value is larger than the common 0.05 percent and therefore we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Since Lot1 p-value is equal to 1, it suggests that there is no difference between lot 1 group and the population group.
Since for lot 3 p-value (0.04168) is smaller than the common 0.05 percent. Therefore, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
