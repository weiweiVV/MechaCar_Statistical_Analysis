# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. According to our result, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
2. According to our result, the overall p-value is significant smaller than 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero
3. The linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
